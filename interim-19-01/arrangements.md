## Meeting Location

[Akamai](https://akamai.com/) is hosting our meeting at their
offices in Tokyo, Japan ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/8cs81Mp1yJx)).

    Akamai Technologies Tokyo Office
    6F, Kyobashi Trust Tower
    2-1-3 Kyobashi, Chuo-ku
    Tokyo 104-0031


## Transportation

Tokyo is served by two major airports.

* [NRT](https://www.narita-airport.jp/en/) is Narita International Airport. The quickest, easiest
  way to get from Narita to the meeting location is to take the [Narita
  Express](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/) train to Tokyo Station, a one-hour trip that costs
  approximately ¥3,020 (¥4,000 round-trip if you buy a [special
  ticket](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/nex_round.html) upon arrival).

* [HND](http://www.haneda-airport.jp/inter/en/) is Haneda International Airport, which is much
  closer to Tokyo, but has slightly fewer international flights. There are a variety of ways to get
  from Haneda to the meeting location, but the most direct is to take the [Keikyu-Kuko
  Line](http://www.haneda-tokyo-access.com/en/) (which changes into the Asakusa Line) to Takaracho
  Station, about a 35 minute train ride.

Upon arrival, it's advisable to get a [Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html) or
[Pasmo](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/) IC card to pay for public transportation, as well as use in
convenience stores and vending machines.

The closest stations to the venue are Kyobashi (Ginza Line), Takaracho (Asakusa Line), and Tokyo Station (too many to list).

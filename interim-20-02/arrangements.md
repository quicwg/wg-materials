This is the arrangements page for the QUIC Working Group's tenth Interim Face-to-Face meeting,
hosted by Google in Zurich, Switzerland.


## Register

**All Attendees -- remote or local -- must register**.

Attendees are expected to be familiar with Working Group drafts and related issues, and to take active part in discussion. All participation takes place under the terms of the IETF [NOTE WELL](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well.html) statement. See our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about participating in QUIC.

If you wish to observe the meeting but not actively participate, you are strongly urged to attend remotely.

Attendees should also note the [agenda](agenda.md), as some topics will be considered out-of-scope for this meeting.

[Register here](). **Registration closes on 10 January 2020.** Since access to
the venue is controlled, *attendees not registered by the deadline will not be
issued visitor badges, and therefore not admitted to the venue.*


## Schedule and Agenda

We'll be meeting Wednesday and Thursday, 5-6 February 2020. Meetings will begin at 9:30am and end
at approximately 5pm on each day (although we may choose to end earlier).

There will also be an **interop event** on 3-4 February (Monday and Tuesday).

See [the agenda](agenda.md) for full details.


## Meeting Location

[Google](https://google.com/) is hosting our meeting at their offices in Zurich.

Monday's interop event will be in the Alptransit room on the third floor of the
Google EURG building ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/N8BwruZkMMd8LXTR6)):

    Gustav-Gull-Platz 1
    8004 Zürich
    Switzerland

Tuesday's interop event will be in the Sihlpost room on the fourth floor of the
Google EURA1 building (also called Sihlpost, the old central post office)
([map](https://goo.gl/maps/5JXtcBV2QRyx1hwn7)):

    Kasernenstrasse 97
    8004 Zürich
    Switzerland

In both cases, access to the building is controlled, and the meeting rooms are
adjacent to the reception area. Find the Google reception entrance at each
building, go to reception, and retrieve your visitor badge upon arrival.

## Transportation

[Zurich Airport](https://www.flughafen-zuerich.ch) (IATA ZRH) is the closest
international airport. 

Both buildings are a short (EURA1: 1 minute, EURG: 6 minutes) walk from the 
Europaallee exit of Zurich main railway station 
([Zürich HB](https://www.sbb.ch/en/station-services/railway-stations/shopville-zuerich-main-station.html)). 
There is a [direct 12-minute train connection](https://goo.gl/maps/AnLnqysrCHJ97vKD9) 
every ten minutes from the airport to HB. Be sure to purchase a ticket (ZVV zones 
110 and 121) before boarding the train.

Auto rental is *not recommended*: long-term parking near the station is scarce
and exorbitantly expensive, even for Zurich.

## Accommodation

There are [numerous hotels](https://www.google.com/maps/search/hotels+near+Zurich+Main+Station,+Bahnhofplatz,+Zürich/) 
within walking distance of the venue and the main station.
